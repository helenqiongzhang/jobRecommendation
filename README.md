üèñÔ∏è Motivation

I'm a fan of travelling. However, most travel applications nowadays specialing in a specific aspect of travelling, for example booking hotels or flights. There isn't a centralized place for storing all your reservations and daily activities. I created this application for users to easily create, organize and manage their travel plans.

## To run application

`npm start`

A browser window should appear. Scan the QR code with your camera to open Expo on your mobile phone.

Don't forget to npm install & install the [Expo-CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)!


üõí Functionality

Once the user opens the app, he or she can create travel events, and add date information for the event. For adding detailed location information for the event, once the user starts typing, the app will provide place suggestions and input-autocompletion.  Whenever a destination is added to the itinerary, a marker will be simultaneously added to the map view in the app and all destinations will be connected with a polyline to visualize the whole travel itinerary for the user.

‚öí Built With

I used react-native to build the frontend components, Google Place API for place suggestion and React-native‚Äôs auto-completion and map libraries. For the backend, I used Express and node.js, for database cloud Firestore, a NoSQL database.
